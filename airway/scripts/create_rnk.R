# Shrunken LFC: Necessary for ranking!!! Also useful to compare LFC across 
# experiments. It is recommended to use these shrunken results when doing DEA.
# Please note that the p-values might vary a little.

### Low count genes have a lot of variance and thus their estimated LFCs can be 
### very extreme and imprecise.
### lfcShrink allows to shrunk the LFC of genes with low counts while conserving
### the LFC of genes with a high number of counts.
### apeglm is the default method, but there are others available:
